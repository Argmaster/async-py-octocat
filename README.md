# async_py_octocat

Async PyOctocat is a Python library for asynchronous interaction with GitHub
API. I was pushed to create this library by the lack of an actively maintained
and well documented library that would allow quick and efficient high-level
interaction with Github from code poses. I sincerely hope that one day this
library can be said to be actively maintained and well documented.

Due to the extensiveness of the Github API, functionalities require incremental
implementation, and at this point PyOctocat is far from having all endpoints
finished. Check Features Status section in our documentation to learn about
features which are already available.

# Example

docs.
